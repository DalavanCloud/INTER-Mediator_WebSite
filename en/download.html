    <h2>Download and Install</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You need any server that PHP is working. INTER-Mediator supports FileMaker Server and PDO supported database
            (such as MySQL) so far. You need to prepare for any database.
        </li>
        <li>Download file from <a href="../archives/INTER-Mediator-4_1.zip">here</a>. Of course, you should extract it.</li>
        <li>Copy the "INTER-Mediator_XXXX" folder into the document folder of your web server. You can change the name
            of "INTER-Mediator_XXXX" folder. This folder is refered as "INTER-Mediator" folder after here.
        </li>
        <li>INTER-Mediator requires the mbstring library on PHP. Usually the Windows's PHP commented out the directive
            for mbstring loading.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Contents of files you downloaded</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The "INTER-Mediator" folder contains the framework and samples. The "INTER-Mediator/Sample" folder contains
            the samples of the applications with using INTER-Mediator.
        </li>
        <li>You could place the "INTER-Mediator" folder to any folders could be included by PHP. You might think the
            file named "INTER-Mediator.js" should be published on web server, even though you don't need as far as you
            are using server based databases.
        </li>
        <li>The easiest way is just copy the whole "INTER-Mediator" folder just as you downloaded into the web document
            folder.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation of FileMaker Server to use samples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>INTER-Mediator needs <a href="http://www.iviking.org/FX.php/" target="_blank">FX.php</a>(This site is
            neither affiliated with nor endorsed by Chris Hansen) for using FileMaker Server. The "FX.php" is including
            INTER-Mediator dictribution in the "INTER-Mediator/lib/FX" folder.
        </li>
        <li>The database file of the FileMaker is the file "TestDB.fp7" on the root folder of you downloaded. You need
            to install the database in FileMaker Server. The admin user of it is "admin" and password is "1234".
        </li>
        <li>FIleMaker Server should support XML sharing. This is the requirement for FX.php.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation of MySQL to use samples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The file "INTER-Mediator/dist_docs/sample_schema_mysql.txt" is the schema definition file for MySQL. You
            could use it with mysql command and the usage of the file is described at the start of it.
        </li>
        <li>Check the file "INTER-Mediator/params.php", and justify the value of $dbDSN variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation of PostgreSQL to use samples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The file "INTER-Mediator/dist_docs/sample_schema_pgsql.txt" is the schema definition file for PostgreSQL.
            You could use it with pgsql command and the usage of the file is described at the start of it.
        </li>
        <li>Check the file "INTER-Mediator/params.php", and justify the value of $dbDSN variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation of SQLite to use samples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The file "INTER-Mediator/dist_docs/sample_schema_sqlite.txt" is the schema definition file for SQLite. You
            could use it with sqlite command and the usage of the file is described at the start of it.
        </li>
        <li>Check the file "INTER-Mediator/params.php", and justify the value of $dbDSN variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Check the samples as like</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You access the "INTER-Mediator/Samples" folder from your web browser. If you copied the "INTER-Mediator"
            folder, you can access the samples index page by "http://host-name/INTER-Mediator/Samples/index.html".
        </li>
        <li>The list of samples is shown. You should choose valid database that you've finished to install.</li>
        <li>"Sample Portal Page" shows table-styled page. If you could see anything in any textfield, you are succeed to
            install. You can see the data in the database on the textfields. Compare with the contents of database and
            the page, you must aware that the data in database is shown on the page. If you are using FileMaker Server,
            you could check with FileMaker Pro. MySQL users should use mysql command or kind of database browsers.
        </li>
        <li>The sample is aiming to record contacts for each person. The design is not nifty because INTER-Mediator is
            not the tool to create good-looking site. After you've checked the textfield is holding the data from the
            database, you edit it and push tab key. After that you will aware that the edited data is stored on the
            database. The textfield on the page with INTER-Mediator can write back the modified data.
        </li>
        <li>Checkbox and Radio Button are working. INTER-Medator support them and read/store on database with the
            status. If you check the data on database after changing the status of them, you can see synchronize with
            database and each controls.
        </li>
        <li>One person has several contact records. INTER-Mediator can handle the one-to-many relations on the web
            page.
        </li>
        <li>Popup menus for Way and Kind is related. You can see to change the items of Kind regarding to Way. Way and
            Kind are many-to-many relationship and there must have a intermediate table on the schema.
        </li>
        <li>You can see the Delete and Insert button. You might have you've expected. Some of them will work on
            one-to-many relationship, for example, the Insert button will create one record and set the appropriate
            value to the foreign-field.
        </li>
        <li>You don't need to do kind of "Save" or "Update".</li>
        <li>"Sample Search Page" is a sample of searching Japanese postal codes. The criteria are already set to the
            textfield, and it's easy way to try with the default criteria. Of course, you can set another criteria.
            INTER-Mediator can show multiple records with each defined records, i.e pagination feature. This sample
            shows the way to build the page after clicking the Search button.
        </li>
        <li>"Sample for HTML5 local database" doesn't work as for Ver.0.7.1. I'm intend to support the HTML5's local
            database and check with the sample. This is the developer's "Should To Do" item.
        </li>
