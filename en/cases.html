                <p><a href="https://redb.kusa.ac.jp/" target="_blank">Education Research Achievement Database of Kurashiki University of Science</a> was developed in the January - February 2016 period using open source software mainly PHP framework CodeIgniter 3, INTER-Mediator 5.3 and Bootstrap 3, and it is operated from March 2016.</p>
                <p>By using this web application, university faculty staff can enter, update and manage educational research performance data on a web basis. In addition, general users can search for educational research achievements of university teachers from faculty names and keywords. CodeIgniter is used for search function and display of performance data. In addition, it is a responsive Web design site using Bootstrap.</p>
                <p>By using INTER-Mediator to realize this web application, we were able to implement data entry, data update, and data management functions of education and research achievement in a shorter time than we thought on any other Ajax ways. In addition, it's using the user management function of INTER-Mediator to construct a member site. By logging in with a user account issued to each faculty member, the faculty can enter performance data without intervention of the secretariat. Moreover updates can be made quickly.</p>

                <h1>"FMPress" which Realizes FileMaker Web Publication without Programming</h1>

 <p>FileMaker, the representative database application available on PC / Mac, is an application that is active in business solutions and personal data management. Since it is easy to build a database, and it is possible to make it firmly, there are many users to use in their business activities. Web publishing can be done by using FileMaker Server, etc. However, as a rule, programming is necessary up to Ver.12, and the ease of using FileMaker has been considerably skewed for the web. However, with Filemaker's hosting service "<a href="https://www.emic.co.jp/fmpress/" title="FMPress" target="_blank">FMPress</a>" provided by Emic, the "<a href="https://www.emic.co.jp/fmpress/publisher/" title="FMPress Publisher" target="_blank">FMPress Publisher</a>" allows you to publish a database created with FileMaker as a web application as it is. INTER-Mediator is used as its service infrastructure. </p>
                <p>By the way, with FileMaker 13, if you use a server, you can use FileMaker database from Web browser with a mechanism called WebDirect. However, at present, performance is low and licensing fee is generated, so it can be said that it is realistic to use the application version for smooth use in business. In addition, WebDirect does not support Android and there are still many restrictions. "<a href="https://www.emic.co.jp/fmpress/publisher/comparison-with-webdirect/" title="FileMaker WebDirect and FMPress Publisher target="_blank">Comparison between FileMaker WebDirect and FMPress Publisher</a>" shows differences of these web publishing features.</p>
                <p> As for the service contents of FMPress, Mr. Atsushi Matsuo of Emic Inc. mentions "FMPress Publisher focuses on lightening the operation using CSS rather than JavaScript as much as possible to reproduce the layout of FileMaker Pro, it is light and suitable for mobile OS, and it is suitable for iOS and Android mobile phones. It also works with Web browsers, scripts, calculation formulas, conditional formats, graphs, etc. There are many functions that are not supported at the moment, but you can use it as a tool to easily share and publish FileMaker Pro databases on the Web. We will continue to enhance and improve our functions in the future so that we can have it. "</p>
                <p>Can WebDirect become mainstream if FileMaker WebDirect performance gets better after five or ten years? Of course, use on WebDirect will gradually increase, but WebDirect replaces the application version of FileMaker Pro, and is a full-featured version of FileMaker. Meanwhile, already in many situations, the Web publishing of FileMaker solutions focuses on "using only limited features as lights", and there is a tendency to make web pages that eliminate unnecessary elements. Demand for custom webs may decrease as a percentage, but we think that usage equivalent to the current needs will not go away. FMPress Publisher can be said to be the best solution to start Webization of such specific functions.</p>

                <h1>Order-made Postcard Management of "Fuchi-Nashi Hagaki Honpo"</h1>
                <p class="article-date">Posted on 2013-6-16</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.aisatu.jp" target="_blank">Fuchi-Nashi Hagaki Honpo</a>" accepts to print postcards such as New Year's cards and hot summer greeting, they built the site for management of orders and progress with INTER-Mediator and the site got started from the hot summer season of 2013. "Fuchi-Nashi Hagaki" means "No border postcard" and printing is expanding to every edge of postcard. They established the technology which can realize borderless printing without cutting around the official postcard. The designs of the postcard change with each order, and they will make a design each time to respond. Fuchi-Nashi Hagaki Honpo and their customers have to interact with print ordering, design decision, and shipping. These are processing them on the site created with INTER-Mediator. Database is FileMaker Server 12, Server machines use Mac mini, internal business processing is FileMaker Pro, and the user interface to the orderer is built with the Web application. In addition, Jimdo is used for the general site for introducing services. </p>
                <p>Kazushi Nishigaya, the representative of the Fuchi-Nashi Hagaki Honpo said, "With the application by the form until last year and using the file transfer service, it took time to match the incoming file and the mail from the customer. We made it by thinking carefully on the new system. It's easy for us to feel easy to use as a service for members of the on-demand printing service because all the functions are integrated." He has self confidence about improvement of customer satisfaction with the new system. Regarding the Web interface, "I heard that development time can be shortened by using INTER-Mediator, so I was able to spend time considering the contents to the very last minute. I am surprised that it is easy to start up and make corrections afterwards." </p>

<h1>INTER-Mediator's site </h1>
                <p>Currently, this site is conducting synthesis of static page data, header, navigation, etc. with INTER-Mediator. We do not use the database, we prepare all the various data in the HTML file.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>INTER-Mediator's Initial and Old Site</h1>
                <p>Since it will not be talked about not being able to make your own site, I first tried making it as a case ... That was the previous story, and since February 2014 we moved to the current static-based site. You can download the source of the old site which is using INTER-Mediator from <a href="../archives/legacy_im_site_2014-Feb.zip">here</a>. Originally I used FileMaker Server, but since I moved to CloudCore it was changed to MySQL. </ P>
                <p>The title of the gray band and the text following it are one record. Therefore, pages such as "Usage Manual" display multiple records in order. Besides the article display, there is also navigation by the ocher box on the right side and display of the news on the top page. One news item is a record. Navigation has table for management and shows it. </p>
                <p>Apart from anything but an irresistible site, the point that has been felt is "multi language". If the browser is Japanese you only need to display Japanese documents in English, but if you are in English you better display the documents, but in fact the circumstances are more complicated. For example, if you are a Korean browser, you need to have a mechanism of "English for undefined languages". Or if you only have Japanese documents in English browsers, you will see Japanese. In addition, there are various patterns such as plural records constituting one page, only English, Japanese only, mixed. In other words, you have to check the language of the browser and the language specified in the document from the list of records and return the appropriate record list. Since this can not be created with simple conditional statements, we have created our own database class that extends the database class. For this class as well, the source is included in the sample program. </p>
                <p> In addition, it seems to be worthwhile to look at samples as a typical example of how to deal with unsupported browsers. </p>

                <h3 style ="text-align: center; background-color: #FFDDEE; padding: 0.5em 0;"> *** We are looking for cases *** </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Please send me a text manuscript. If possible we are happy if there is a screen shot etc, but even if there is not it, it is OK. </li>
                    <li>In the case of contracted development, please obtain permission from your client if possible. If it is impossible to do so, it may be content that blurred around it. </li>
                    <li>Since the above e-mail address may be buried in spam, it may be good to contact Masayuki Nii by searching real name on Facebook. </li>
                    <li>If you posted, I will give you something, modestly.</li>
                    <li>The order of each case on the site is the charge of site administrators.</li>
